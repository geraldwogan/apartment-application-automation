## Filling out apartment applications on Daft.ie automatically.

I'm currently searching for an apartment using Daft.ie. 

This website allows a user to setup alerts based on a number of user-decided parameters such as location, price, etc.

These alerts result in an email being sent to the user from the address: "Daft.ie Enquiry <noreply@daft.ie>".

The current aim of this project is to build a program that:
1. listens for alerts/email
1. navigates to the advertisement
1. fills out the initial application forms
1. send the application form.

From what I have seen online, the place to start is Selenium. I'm going to do some googling and see which path to take.
