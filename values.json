I am interested in renting this lovely apartment! \n\nPlease let me know if viewings are available at this time. I would be available to move in as soon as the apartment is available. \n\nI can provide a glowing reference from a former college professor of mine in addition to a work reference and a previous landlord reference. I can also provide a payslip as proof of funds. \n\nThank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon. \n\nKindest Regards, \nGerald Wogan."
